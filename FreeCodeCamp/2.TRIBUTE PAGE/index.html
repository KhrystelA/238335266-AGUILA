        Dr. José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda (June 19, 1861 – December 30, 1896) was a Filipino nationalist, writer, and revolutionary.
        He is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines and a key figure in the country's revolution against Spanish colonial rule.

      <p>
        Rizal's famous novels, "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," exposed the injustices of Spanish rule in the Philippines. He fought for peaceful reforms, education, and the Filipino people’s right to independence. 
        His life, works, and execution by the Spanish authorities in 1896 fueled the Philippine Revolution.
